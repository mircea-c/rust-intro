# rust-intro

So I've decided to learn Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/). As I'll be doing some hands on examples from the book, I'd like to keep them handy in a git repo.

Tadaaaa!

I'll be pushing each project into a different orphaned branch (something I've never used before that seems to fit this particular exercise).
